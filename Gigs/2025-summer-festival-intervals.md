2. "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything... just like country song lyrics!"

### Audience Participation Games

  2. Hand him the huge tambourine and encourage him to play along with the band.
  3. Use humor to engage the audience and make it a fun, memorable moment.

## Timing Guidelines

- Keep all breaks under 5 minutes
- Monitor audience energy
- If crowd is especially engaged, shorten intervals
- If setup requires more time, use extended joke sequences

## Performance Notes

- Practice smooth transitions between songs and intervals
- Ensure all props are positioned side-stage for easy access
- Designate a band member to watch time during intervals
- Have contingency plan for equipment failures
