### Hat Joke & Costume Change Segment
1. Band members line up at front of stage
2. Tobias: "You know what they say about country folk with big hats..." (pause)
3. [Band member 2]: "They're compensating for small guitar picks!"
4. All members swap hats in an exaggerated manner
5. While banter continues, band members begin quick costume change for "Man! I Feel Like A Woman"
6. [Band member 3]: "Speaking of feeling different..." (transition to costume reveal)
7. Full costume reveal with dramatic flourish as introduction to Shania Twain song

### Prop Requirements

- Dramatic lighting change to accompany costume reveal

## Second Break

**Duration**: 3-4 minutes
**After**: "Achy Breaky Heart"

### Banjo Tuning Joke
1. [Band member 3] pretends to struggle with banjo
2. Tobias: "How many country musicians does it take to tune a banjo?"
3. Audience call-out opportunity
4. [Band member 2]: "None! Banjos are never in tune anyway!"
5. [Band member 3] looks offended, then produces perfect banjo riff
6. Use this time for second costume adjustment

### Prop Requirements
- Fake "broken" banjo string
- Pre-tuned backup banjo for the perfect riff
- Quick-change costume elements

## Emergency Fill Material

Use these if there are technical difficulties or we need to extend set time:

### Country Music Jokes
1. "What do you call a country singer who's lost his dog, his truck, and his wife? A songwriter!"
2. "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything... just like country song lyrics!"
3. "How can you tell if a country singer is extroverted? They stare at YOUR boots while they're talking to you!"

### Audience Participation Games
1. **Country Song Title Mashup**: Call out to audience for random words, create impromptu "country song title" from responses
2. **Quick Draw**: Have audience members compete in fastest "air guitar" solo

## Timing Guidelines
- Keep all breaks under 5 minutes
- Monitor audience energy
- If crowd is especially engaged, shorten intervals
- If setup requires more time, use extended joke sequences

## Cotton Eye Joe Comedy

**Duration**: 3-5 minutes  
**Special Status**: Encode (extended comedy version)

### Pre-Song Setup
1. All band members don ridiculous blonde wigs
2. Tobias announces: "Now for a very special encoding of Cotton Eye Joe!"

### During Song Comedy Elements
1. **Verse 1**: Normal performance with exaggerated Swedish accents
2. **Chorus 1**: Interrupt with "Swedish lesson" - teach audience fake Swedish phrases:
   - "Hej mitt namn är Cotton" (Hello my name is Cotton)
   - "Var kom du ifrån?" (Where did you come from?)
   - "Var gick du?" (Where did you go?)
3. **Verse 2**: Each band member does increasingly ridiculous Scandinavian dance moves
4. **Bridge**: Freeze frame moment - entire band freezes mid-dance while one member tells a joke:
   - "If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe, I'd have been married long time ago!"
   - "Where did you come from, where did you go? Seriously, has anyone seen my wife?"
5. **Final Chorus**: Full-speed dance routine with fiddle playing at double speed

### Prop Requirements
- Blonde wigs for all band members
- Swedish flag handkerchiefs
- Oversized wooden clogs for one band member
- Cheat sheet with "Swedish" pronunciation (can be comedically large)

### Performance Notes
- Rehearse "bad" Swedish accents thoroughly
- Time the freeze frame perfectly for comedy effect
- Practice speed transitions for final chorus
- Prepare for audience to join dance routine

## Performance Notes
- Practice smooth transitions between songs and intervals
- Ensure all props are positioned side-stage for easy access
- Designate a band member to watch time during intervals
- Have contingency plan for equipment failures
