## Content Structure

1. **Direct Answer**: Begin with a clear, concise answer to the core question
2. **Evidence**: Provide facts, research findings, or technical specifications that support the answer
3. **Technical Context**: Include relevant IT architectural considerations where appropriate
4. **Practical Application**: Explain how the information can be applied in practice
5. **References**: Cite authoritative sources, standards, or documentation (when available)

## Format Preferences
