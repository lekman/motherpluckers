# AI Wordblock Guidelines

## Introduction for AI Agents

The following lists identify overused phrases and words that should be avoided in AI-generated content. These words and phrases often create a stilted, formulaic tone that makes AI text easily identifiable and less natural. When generating text for documentation, articles, or any professional communication, avoid these terms to create more natural, direct, and effective content. 

The goal is to communicate clearly and directly without relying on filler phrases, buzzwords, or overly formal transitional language. Good writing should be concise, straightforward, and genuinely helpful rather than artificially "professional-sounding."
