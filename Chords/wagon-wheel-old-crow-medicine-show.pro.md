H[G]eading down south to the l[D]and of the pines
I'm [Em]thumbing my way into N[C]orth Caroline
St[G]aring up the road and p[D]ray to God I see h[C]eadlights
I [G]made it down the coast in s[D]eventeen hours
[Em]Picking me a bouquet of d[C]ogwood flowers
And I'm a-[G]hopin' for Raleigh, I can s[D]ee my baby ton[C]ight

R[G]unning from the cold [D]up in New England
I was [Em]born to be a fiddler in an [C]old time string band

Oh, n[G]orth country winters keep a-g[D]etting me down

W[G]alkin' to the south o[D]ut of Roanoke
I caught a t[Em]rucker out of Philly, had a n[C]ice long toke
But h[G]e's a heading west from the C[D]umberland gap
To J[C]ohnson City, Tennessee
I g[G]otta get a move on b[D]efore the sun

And [G]if I die in Raleigh at l[D]east I will die[C]free
