{comment: Intro}
[G] [Cadd9][G][Cadd9]

{start_of_verse}
[G]We both lie silently still, in the [Cadd9]dead of the night.
Although we b[G]oth lie close together, we feel m[Cadd9]iles apart inside.
Was it som[G]ething I said, or so[Cadd9]mething I did,
did my wo[G]rds not come out [Cadd9]right?
Though I t[D]ried not to hurt you, though I [C]tried, but I guess that's why they say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[G]Every rose has its t[Cadd9]horn.
Just like e[G]very night has its [Cadd9]dawn.
Just like e[G]very cow[D]boy sings a sa[C]d, sad s[G]ong.
E[G]very rose has its th[C]orn. Yeah, it does.
{end_of_chorus}

{comment: Instrumental}
[G] [Cadd9][G][Cadd9]

{start_of_verse}
I [G]listen to our favorite song, playing on the [Cadd9]radio.
Hear the D[G]J say love's a game of easy come and[Cadd9]easy go.
But I w[G]onder, does he[Cadd9] know, has he [G]ever felt like t[Cadd9]his?
And I k[D]now that you'd be here right now if I
[C]coulda let you know, somehow I guess
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[G]Every rose has its t[Cadd9]horn.
Just like e[G]very night has its [Cadd9]dawn.
Just like e[G]very co[D]wboy sings a s[C]ad, sad [G]song.
E[G]very rose has its th[C]orn.
{end_of_chorus}

{comment: Bridge}
[Em]  Though it's been a w[D]hile now, I can s[C]till feel so much p[G]ain.
[Em] Like a knife that c[D]uts you the wound heals[C], but the scar, that scar remains

[G] [Cadd9][G][Cadd9]

{start_of_verse}
I k[G]now I coulda saved our love that night if I'd[Cadd9]known what to say.
[G]  Instead of making love we both[Cadd9]made our separate ways.
And n[G]ow I hear you've found [Cadd9]somebody new, and [G]that I never meant that [Cadd9]much to you.
To h[D]ear that tears me up inside, and to s[C]ee you cuts me like a knife, I guess
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[G]Every rose has its t[Cadd9]horn.
Just like e[G]very night has its [Cadd9]dawn.
Just like eve[G]ry cow[D]boy sings a sa[C]d, sad s[G]ong.
