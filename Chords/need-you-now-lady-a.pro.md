## Chords

```
Tuning: [E][A][D][G][B][E]

{start_of_verse}
[G]Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor
[C]Reaching for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore
[G]And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
[C]For me it happens all the time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
It's a [G]quarter after one, I'm all alone and I [C]need you now
Said I [G]wouldn't call but I lost all control and I [C]need you now
And I [G]don't know how I can do without, I just [C]need you now
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
[G]Another shot of whiskey can't stop looking at the door
[C]Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before
[G]And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
[C]For me it happens all the time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
It's a [G]quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I [C]need you now
Said I [G]wouldn't call but I lost all control and I [C]need you now
And I [G]don't know how I can do without, I just [C]need you now
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_bridge}
[G]Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all
[C]It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I [G]need you now
And I [C]said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I [G]need you now
And I [C]don't know how I can do without, I just [G]need you now
{end_of_bridge}

{start_of_chorus}
I just [G]need you now
I just [C]need you now
{end_of_chorus}
```
