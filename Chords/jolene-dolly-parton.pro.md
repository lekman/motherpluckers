Ooh, I'm [G]begging of you, please don't take my [Am]man
Jo[Am]lene, Jo[C]lene, Jo[G/B]lene, Jo[Am]lene
[G]Please don't take him even though you[Am]can
{end_of_chorus}

Your [Am]beauty is be[C]yond compare,
With [G]flaming locks of [Am]auburn hair,
With [G]ivory skin and eyes of emerald[Am]green
{end_of_verse}

Your [Am]smile is like a [C]breath of spring,
Your [G]skin is soft like [Am]summer rain,
And [G]I cannot compete with you, Jo[Am]lene

And [Am]I could easily [C]understand
How [G]you could easily [Am]take my man
But you [G]don't know what he means to me, Jo[Am]lene

And he [Am]talks about you [C]in his sleep,
There's [G]nothing I can [Am]do to keep
From [G]crying, when he calls your name, Jo[Am]lene ... Jolene

[Am]Had to have this [C]talk with you,
My [G]happiness de[Am]pends on you,
What[G]ever you decide to do, Jo[Am]lene
{end_of_verse}

And [Am]you could have your [C]choice of men,
But [G]I could never [Am]love again
Cos [G]he's the only one for me, Jo[Am]lene ... Jolene
