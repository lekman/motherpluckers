{subtitle:Chris Stapleton}

[Verse 1]
G                                   Am
Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
C               Am               G   C/G  G
Liquor was the only love I've known
    G                                          Am
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
            C        Am             G   C/G  G
And brought me back from being too far gone

[Chorus]
            G   C/G  G                  Am
You're as smooth     as Tennessee whiskey
            C  Am                 G  C/G  G
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
           G                    Am
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
                    C             Am           G   C/G  G
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Verse 2]
      G                                        Am
I've looked for love in all the same old places
C                  Am                      G  C/G  G
Found the bottom of a bottle was always dry

    G                                                Am
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
                C                 Am             G     D
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high, yeah


[Chorus]
     C      G   C/G  G                 Am
You're as smooth     as Tennessee whiskey
            C  Am                 G   C/G  G
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
           G                     Am
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
                    C             Am           G  C/G  G
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time


[Instrumental Harmonica]
G  G  Am  Am  C  Am  G  C/G  G
G  G  Am  Am  C  Am  G  C/G  G


[Chorus]
            G   C/G  G                 Am
You're as smooth     as Tennessee whiskey
            C  Am                 G  C/G  G
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
           G                     Am
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
                    C             Am           G  C/G  G
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time


[Outro]
           G   C/G  G                 Am
You're as smooth     as Tennessee whiskey
               C  Am               G  C/G  G
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey
            G   C/G  G                 Am
You're as smooth     as Tennessee whiskey
               C
Tennessee whiskey
Am               G
Tennessee whiskey
