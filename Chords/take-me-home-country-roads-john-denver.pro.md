[G]  Almost Heaven[Em], West Virginia[D], Blue Ridge Mountains, [C]Shenandoah [G]River.

[G] All my memories[Em]  gather 'round her[D], miner's lady, [C]stranger to blue [G]water.

[Em] I hear her [D/F#]voice, in the [G]mornin' hour she calls me.
The [C]radio re[G]minds me of my [D]home far away.
And [Em]drivin' down the [F]road I get a [C]feelin' that I [G]should have been home
[D]yesterday, yester[D7]day.

Country [G]Roads, take me [D]home, to the [Em]place I be[C]long
