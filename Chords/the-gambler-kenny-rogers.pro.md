{start_of_verse}
[G]On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,
[C]I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.
[G]So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness
[C]'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
[G]He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,
[C]and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.
[G]And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.
[C]For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice."
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
[G]So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow.
[C]Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.
[G]And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.
[C]Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[G]You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
[C]know when to walk away and know when to run.
[G]You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
[C]There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
[G]Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
[C]is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep.
[G]'Cause ev'ry hand's a winner and ev'ry hand's a loser,
[C]and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep."
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
[G]And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,
[C]crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.
[G]And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.
[C]But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[G]You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
[C]know when to walk away and know when to run.
[G]You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
[C]There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.

[G]You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
[C]know when to walk away and know when to run.
[G]You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
[C]There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.

[G]You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
[C]know when to walk away and know when to run.
[G]You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
[C]There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
{end_of_chorus}
